## Operations

### Athenaeum Project

The first phase of this exciting project is now underway, with the construction of new offices. This work is taking place in the late afternoons and weekends in order to have minimal impact on the need for quiet study and workspace.

Students are reminded that there are five study rooms available on the second floor, along with more study tables and individual carrels, Room 202 (a computer lab when not in use for classes), and the Foley classroom, which becomes a quiet zone after 6:00 PM.

Leisure Reading, which includes books, puzzles, and games, has been relocated next to the DVD collection. New Books and faculty publications can also be found in the same area. All librarians are now located in the Library Administrative Office next to the 24-Hour Room for questions and research consultations.
