title: "September 2025: Hofheimer Happenings"
date: 2025-09-10
summary: |
  The library has several updates this month. Our shelf-shifting project is now complete, though construction will continue for a few weeks on the second floor near the University Archives. For quieter study space, students can use rooms and seating on the opposite side of the floor. Some “A–E” shelves are temporarily mislabeled, so ask staff if you need help locating materials.

We’ve also updated our operating hours: the library is now open on Saturdays, and Sunday hours have been extended through midnight.

November’s display highlights Native American Heritage Month, featuring books by Tommy Orange, Moniquill Blackgoose, and Stephen Graham Jones.

Two trial databases—Applied Science & Technology Source Ultimate and World Politics Review—remain available, but only until early and late December.

The library’s YouTube channel now includes new instructional videos on annotated bibliographies, peer-reviewed sources, and using library databases. There’s also a new feature introducing the library’s zine collection.

### **Generative Artificial Intelligence FAQ**
A [recent study](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/00222429251314491) found that *students with lower AI literacy are more likely to rely on AI to complete assignments.*

Tools like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini can be useful, but they:
- lack consciousness  
- do not know what is true  
- cannot replace human experts  

Learn how they work and explore a glossary of GAI terms on our
