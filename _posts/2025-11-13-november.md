date: 2025-11-13
summary: |
  The library’s big shelf-shifting project is officially done, though you’ll still
  see some construction happening on the second floor near the University Archives
  and Study Room 3. If you’re hunting for a quiet spot to study or meet, head to
  the opposite side of the floor—it’s calmer there while work continues. Some
  sections (A–E) are temporarily mislabeled from the shift, so don’t hesitate to
  ask staff for help finding what you need. We’ve also expanded our weekend hours,
  with Saturday openings and later Sunday nights now part of our regular schedule.
  
  November brings a Native American Heritage Month display, featuring bestselling
  authors like Tommy Orange, Moniquill Blackgoose, and Stephen Graham Jones. 
  
  Don’t forget: trial access to Applied Science & Technology Source Ultimate ends
  December 3, and World Politics Review ends December 31. 
  
  Plus, the library’s YouTube channel just dropped new videos on research skills, databases, scholarly
  sources, and more—including a spotlight on our zine collection.

## Announcements

### Stack Shifting Complete

The library’s shelf shifting project was completed this past week. The VWU campus community will notice ongoing construction over the coming weeks on the library’s second floor, outside of the University Archives and Study Room 3.

For quieter study space and meetings, patrons are encouraged to utilize the rooms and spaces on the opposite side of the second floor.

Additionally, our ranges from sections “A” through “E” are currently mislabeled as a result of shelf shifting and will require new signage. Patrons who require books from those sections are encouraged to ask for assistance while we produce new signage for those ranges.

### New Operational Hours

The library is pleased to announce an extension in operational hours, which went into effect this past Saturday. Moving forward, the library will be open on Saturdays and will extend hours on Sundays according to the following schedule:

- **Monday–Thursday:** 8:00 AM – 12:00 AM (Midnight)
