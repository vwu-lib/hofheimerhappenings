title: "January 2024: Hofheimer Happenings"
date: 2024-01-01
summary: >
  January Term is underway, with weekday daytime hours in effect through the end of the term.
  Extended evening hours for the Spring Semester will begin on Monday, January 29, giving
  students more time to study, research, and use the library’s spaces.

  During January Term, Hofheimer Librarians are hosting Warm-up Wednesdays with hot
  chocolate and doughnuts, and in February they’ll join the Love Liberally 2024 event
  to present LoveLibs with AI—a playful introduction to generative AI, prompt design,
  and how machine-generated writing compares to human creativity.

  New displays marking Martin Luther King Jr. Day and International Holocaust
  Remembrance Day / Yom Hashoah highlight books, films, and online resources, while
  updated genre labels in the Leisure Reading collection make it easier to browse by
  category. Later this month, the library will also add access to more than 70 journals
  from ACS Publications (American Chemical Society), expanding coverage in chemistry,
  biology, and environmental sciences through the VIVA consortium.

## Events

### Warm-up Wednesdays

During January Term, join the Hofheimer Librarians for **Warm-up Wednesdays** for hot chocolate and doughnuts from **8:30–9:00 a.m.** There are still two Wednesdays left—stop by, warm up, and say hello!

### Love Liberally 2024

Librarians **Kelsi Dunman** and **Abe Nemon** will be at **Love Liberally 2024** (organized by the INTEL Committee) in Beverley Hall on **February 12, 4:00–5:30 p.m.**, to present **LoveLibs with AI**.

This fun activity lets you create zany letters, poems, haikus, and more using ChatGPT. We’ll talk about what generative AI is and how it works, discuss how using different attributes in prompts can result in richer and more creative outputs, and reflect on what the similarities and differences between outputs can tell us about how a generative AI “thinks” compared to human writers.
