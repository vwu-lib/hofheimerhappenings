title: "October 2025: Hofheimer Happenings"
date: 2025-10-08
summary: |
  October brings a mix of schedule updates, building changes, and new resources at
  Hofheimer Library. Fall Break is just around the corner, with adjusted hours from
  Thursday, October 9, through Sunday, October 12. 
  
  At the same time, a portion of the upstairs collection is being shifted to make room for a new historical
  collection, so some materials may be temporarily out of place—library staff are
  ready to help you track down anything you need.
  
  The month also features several opportunities to get support and connect with the
  campus community. Students can drop by the Midterm Mash for snacks, prizes,
  tutoring, and a resume workshop, while the Page to Podium lecture series continues
  with a talk by Dr. Tyler Lehrer in the Forum. Faculty are encouraged to submit
  course reserve and research instruction requests early in the semester so library
  staff can best support upcoming classes and assignments.
  
  On the collections and research side, the library is highlighting a Halloween film
  display with both spooky favorites and cozy autumn classics, alongside two new
  databases: the Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies and Market Atlas
  by Mergent. 
  
  Faculty interested in open educational resources will also want to
  note that applications are now open for VIVA Open Grants, with information
  sessions scheduled later in the month and a proposal deadline of November 5.

## Electronic Resources

### New Databases

We have two new databases this semester—please check them out in the [Databases](https://guides.vwu.edu/az.php) section of the library website.

The **[Fortunoff Video Archive for Holocaust Testimonies](https://vwu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://fortunoff.library.yale.edu/research/search-the-archive/)** was created by the Holocaust Survivors Film Project and later donated to Yale, which continues to grow and maintain the collection. The archive contains more than 12,000 recorded hours and 4,400 testimonies from Holocaust survivors and witnesses.

**[Market Atlas](https://vwu.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://marketatlas.mergent.com/)** by Mergent has also been added to our collection. It contains numerous analyses of business-related topics and serves as the replacement for Mergent’s soon-to-be discontinued Mergent Online database.
