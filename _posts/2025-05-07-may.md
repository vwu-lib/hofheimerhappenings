## Announcements

### Return Books Ahead of Summer!

Do you have library books checked out that will be due over the summer? We encourage students, especially graduating seniors, to return their books ahead of summer to avoid unnecessary fines and fees.

Need your books for the summer? No worries—just let us know! Email Outreach and Access Services Librarian, Kelsi Dunman, at [kdunman@vwu.edu](mailto:kdunman@vwu.edu) to discuss any questions regarding checkouts and renewals over the summer.

### Introducing Ken Ashley!

Born and raised in Chesapeake, Virginia, Ken Ashley is a graduate student at Old Dominion University, where he is expected to graduate with his MLIS degree. He has worked as a paraprofessional in public libraries for more than four years and currently holds a Bachelor of Arts in English from Old Dominion University.

Ken’s article, “What’s Under the Rug: Managing Harassment in Libraries,” was recently published in the open access journal *Virginia Libraries*. His passions include environmental and social justice, poetry, film history, and old-school country music. He hopes to continue creating inclusive, accessible, and engaging library environments as a new professional.

Ken will complete his internship requirements at H. C. Hofheimer II Library this summer ahead of his graduation; he will be in the library Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays this summer, starting May 20. Feel free to come by and say hello!
